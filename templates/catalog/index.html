        <p>U.S. President Joe Biden warned Thursday night that "equality and democracy are under assault" in the U.S. as he sounded an alarm about his predecessor, Donald Trump, and "MAGA Republican" adherents, labelling them an extremist threat to the nation and its future. Aiming to reframe the November elections as part of a battle for the nation's soul - "the work of my presidency," Biden used his prime-time speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia to argue that Trump and "Make America Great Again" allies are a challenge to nation's system of government, its standing abroad and its citizens' way of life.</p>
